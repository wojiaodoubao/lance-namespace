# Lance Catalog

**Lance Catalog** is an OpenAPI specification on top of the storage-based Lance format.
It provides an integration point for catalog service like Apache Hive MetaStore (HMS), Apache Gravitino, etc. 
to store and use Lance tables. To integrate, the catalog service implements a **Lance Catalog Adapter**, 
which is a REST server that converts the Lance catalog requests to native requests against the catalog service.
Different tools can integrate with Lance Catalog using the generated OpenAPI clients in various languages,
and invoke operations in Lance Catalog to read, write and manage Lance tables in the integrated catalog services.

## Development Guide

### Install OpenAPI Generator

We use [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) 
to generate various clients and servers for the catalog specification.
We recommend installing the tool through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/openapi-generator-cli/) 
for consistent experience across platforms.
First time setup of virtual environment and installation:

```bash
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Develop Rust

```bash
cd rust

# clean all existing generated modules
make clean

# clean, and then generate all clients and servers
make gen 

# clean and generate the rust reqwest client
make gen-rust-reqwest-client

# clean, generate and build all clients and servers
make build
```

### Develop Java

```bash
cd java

# clean all existing generated modules
make clean

# clean, and then generate all clients and servers
make gen 

# clean and generate the Java Apache client
make gen-java-apache-client

# clean and generate the Java Spring Boot server
make gen-java-springboot-server

# clean, generate and build all clients and servers
make build
```
